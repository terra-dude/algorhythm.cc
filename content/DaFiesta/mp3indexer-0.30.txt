mp3indexer 0.30
----------------

INTRODUCTION
-------------
mp3indexer is a C script to sort mp3's into a genre, alpha and group
directory, and while sorting it'll write a list of all mp3's it found to
an ascii-text database file. This ascii-text file can then be used with
glftpd to make a super duper ultra fast "site locate" command for searching
mp3's... (use 'locate.sh' for that, included in this release!)

It's written in C, so it'll outperform any bash/perl/python scripts already
found on the net! And by the way: i wasn't even able to find a script that
creates an ascii-text while sorting. So this will save you from running 2
scripts the cycle the filesystem...

Changes since 0.19:
  - Total redesign to fix a couple of design errors.
  - Fixed 3 bugs regarding file & owner-chip.
  - Made configuration super easy, even a monkey can configure it now!.
  - Little performance tweaks.
  - Yet removed remaining overhead as much has possible, lowering CPU intensitivity


INTALLATION
------------

- First edit the Makefile and make sure GLFTPD_PATH points to you glftpd installation.

- type make && make install to compile/install mp3indexer

  EXPERT NOTE: - It will create the folowing directory's
			GLFTPD_PATH/index/genre
			GLFTPD_PATH/index/alpha
			GLFTPD_PATH/index/group
	       - It will install "mp3indexer" to GLFTPD_PATH/bin
	       - And it will install a sample configuration into GLFTPD_PATH/etc/mp3indexer

- Next, open GLFTPD_PATH/etc/mp3indexer.conf (/glftpd/etc/mp3indexer.conf)
  and configure your directories. You can add more MP3_DIR lines if
  required. Configuration should be self-explanatory.

- Finally, add it to the crontab so it'll run at least once a day.

  Example:

   0 */4 * * * /glftpd/bin/mp3indexer /glftpd/etc/mp3indexer.conf

- READ THE BELOW NOTICE!

IMPORTANT NOTICE:
-----------------
	mp3indexer does *NOT* create the parent index directories. So
	if you don't want the default directories (GLFTPD_PATH/index/alpha,
	GLFTPD_PATH/index/genre, GLFTPD_PATH/index/group) then you have
	to create these directories yourself before you run mp3indexer
	the first time.

For questions: I'm on IRC. If you know me, talk to me other wise RIP!

Have fun!
