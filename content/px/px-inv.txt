# Secure invite script v0.9 by pexi
# This script is in development stage.
# USE AT OWN RISK.
# Please report any bugs, ideas or comments!
# irc: pexi @ efnet
# mail: me@pexi.net 

# PURPOSE:
# Some sites have invite from irc disabled due to security reasons.
# With this script users can add their irc bnc/host from site and get
# invited from irc. The script checks if users host matches with the one he
# has added if it does, the bot invites him.
# The script can also announce invite messages to channel (also bad invites)
# Allowed format for hosts is:
# ident@*.domain.host.com ident@host.com ident@ip.ip.ip.*


# INSTALLATION:
# cp px-inv.tcl -> bot script folder and load it to your eggdrop
# cp px-inv.sh /glftpd/bin
# cp px-inv_verify.sh /glftpd/bin
# IF YOU DONT HAVE PASSCHK IN YOUR GLFTPD BIN FOLDER THEN:
# gcc -lcrypt -O2 -o passchk passchk.c
# and cp passchk /glftpd/bin
# the passchk binary that comes with darkon3's zs is ok. 
# edit px-inv.sh, px-inv_verify.sh and px-inv.tcl
# add 
# site_cmd irc_inv         EXEC    /bin/px-inv.sh
# custom-irc_inv           *
# to glftpd.conf
# make px-inv.sh px-inv_verify.sh px-inv.tcl executable (chmod +x)
# touch /glftpd/ftp-data/misc/px-inv.data (this is the default path)
# make sure px-inv.data can be read and write.
# done.

# USAGE:
# From site:
# site irc_inv (shows valid commands)
# site irc_inv list (shows users currently added irc host)
# site irc_inv add ident@host (adds users irc host)
# From irc:
# /msg botname !invite(or what your trigger is) user pass
