README for ugly-latepre-1.0

 * ABOUT

Latepre is a simple script (and a dirty hack) for catching affils that skip pre
on your site.  It uses pre_dir_check in glftpd.conf to check if a newdir matches
one of your affils and, if so, logs the date and dirname to a database that can
be viewed with the 'latepre' command.  The latepre script itself only takes one
argument, 'clean', which erases the database.

 * INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION

Copy latepre.sh to your glftpd/bin dir and 'chmod 755' it.  Set up the latepre
database like so:

 'touch /jail/glftpd/ftp-data/misc/latepres'
 'chmod 666 /jail/glftpd/ftp-data/misc/latepres'

If you do not currently have a pre_dir_check defined in glftpd.conf, copy
lpdirscript.sh to glftpd/bin and 'chmod 755' it.  Then change this line in
glftpd.conf:

 #pre_dir_check  /bin/dirscript

to

 pre_dir_check  /bin/lpdirscript.sh

If you currently have a (non-binary) pre_dir_check, then just add the contents
of lpdirscript.sh to it (excluding the '#!/bin/bash' and 'exit 0' parts).  If
your pre_dir_check is a binary, check its configuration file for a way to
execute a script after the pre_dir_check has been run.

Lastly, add these lines to glftpd.conf:

 site_cmd LATEPRE        EXEC    /bin/latepre.sh
 
 custom-latepre          !8 *

Change the permissions on "custom-latepre" if you don't want everyone on your
site to be able to view the latepres.

Use 'site latepre' to view the database, and 'site latepre clean' to clear it.
