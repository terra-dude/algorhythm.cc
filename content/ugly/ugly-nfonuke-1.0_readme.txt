README for ugly-nfonuke 1.0

 * ABOUT

Nfonuke scans a list of dirs for directories of a defined minimum age that are
missing NFOs, and nukes them with a specified nuke multiplier.  It allows the
user to specify a list of patterns that, if matched, will be exempted from
nuking.  The script is designed for use with crontab.

Nfonuke works on an assumption: if a directory contains a SFV somewhere in its
hierarchy, then in all cases it also must contain an NFO in its hierarchy too.  
Basically, if a directory does not have a SFV, it may not have a NFO, so it
won't be nuked by the script.   This is often the case in "sample fixes" and
similar, which may only contain an AVI/MPG.

It does not matter if a dir contains an NFO within a subdir, it won't get
nuked.

 * INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION

Copy nfonuke.sh to the directory you want it executed and 'chmod 755' it.  The
script requires a (preferably) dedicated login for nuking, so add a user to
your site with the +4A flags.

Open the script in an editor and change the default configuration.

Add a line to crontab ('crontab -e') similar to this:

  * */4 * * *   /jail/glftpd/bin/nfonuke.sh

The above line will execute the script every 4 hours.  Note that the script
does not need to be placed in the glftpd/bin directory.

FreeBSD users will need to install sh-utils (available in the ports tree as
misc/sh-utils) for this script to work.
