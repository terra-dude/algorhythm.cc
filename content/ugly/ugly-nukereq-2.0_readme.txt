README for ugly-nukereq 2.0

 * ABOUT

Nukereq allows users to request nukes in a similar fashion to 'site request'.
It contains a shell script for use on the site itself and/or by an eggdrop
(through nukereq.tcl).  It allows all users on a chan in which a sitebot resides
to add a nuke request using the "!nukereq <rel> <reason>" command.  Users can
also list active requests with the "!nukereqls" command, or delete a request
(can be disabled) with the "!nukereq del <#>" or "!nukereq del <name>" commands.
Note that the nukereq script can NOT actually nuke a release, rather it provides
an easy way for nukers to find rels to nuke.

 * INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION

Copy the nukereq.sh script to your glftpd/bin dir and 'chmod 755' it.  Copy the
nukereq.tcl script to your sitebot's scripts dir and add it to the config.  Copy
the nukerequests.* files to your glftpd/ftp-data/misc/ dir.  Finally, create
and set the proper permissions for the nukereq database file:

 'touch /path/to/glftpd/ftp-data/misc/nukerequests'
 'chmod 666 /path/to/glftpd/ftp-data/misc/nukerequests'

If you won't be running the script as a site command, you can 'chmod 600' the
nukerequests file instead.  Ensure that the file is owned by the same user
that is running your eggdrop.

As for configuration, edit the nukereq.sh file and change the top five variables
as needed.  If you set del_pub to "YES", then users will be able to issue the 
'!nukereq del ...' command in the channel(s) that your sitebot resides.  If set
to "NO", deletion will only be possible when using the script as a site command.
(The script detects whether it's run through the site or not).  Note that this
deletes the nuke request from the database, NOT the actual release.

You will also need to modify "nukereq.tcl" if your glftpd root path is not
"/glftpd".

If you set del_pub="NO", and wish to only allow only certain users or groups to
delete a request from the database, then add these two lines to your
glftpd.conf:

  site_cmd NUKEREQ        EXEC    /bin/nukereq.sh

  custom-nukereq          1 A B
  (the above line will allow only nukers, unnukers, and siteops to execute the 
  script from the site)

For more information about the syntax of the script, issue '!nukereq help' from
a channel, or 'site nukereq help' from the site.
