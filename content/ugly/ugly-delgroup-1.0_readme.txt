README for ugly-delgroup 1.0

 * ABOUT

Delgroup allows siteops to delete a group and all the users in it with one
command.  The script takes two arguments: -force and -purge. The '-force' flag
overrides the script's default behavior by deleting users who are in other
groups besides the one the user is deleting.  The '-purge' flag deletes users,
purges them, changes multi-group users out of the group (if '-force' wasn't
specified), and finally deletes the group itself. If a user that is to be
deleted is logged into the site at the time, (s)he will be kicked first before
being deleted/purged.  Lastly, the script can also readd deleted users (if
'-purge' wasn't specified).  Group name is case insensitive.

 * INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION

Copy delgroup.sh to your glftpd/bin dir and 'chmod 755' it.  The script makes
use of a (preferably) dedicated siteop user, so add a user to the site with
the following flags: +14D (siteop, exempt, and kick).

Open the script in an editor and change the ftp username/pass/host/ip.

This script requires that 'lftp' be present in your glftpd/bin dir.  If your
lftp binary is dynamically linked, which it likely is, then you will have to
copy a number of libraries into your glftpd/lib dir.  Use 'ldd /path/to/lftp'
for a list of required libraries and their paths.  If you're using lftp+TLS you
will need to create the 'random' dev.  To do this, enter:

 'mknod /jail/glftpd/dev/random c 1 8' in Linux 

 'mknod /jail/glftpd/dev/random c 2 3' in FreeBSD

 'mknod /jail/glftpd/dev/random c 45 0' in OpenBSD

 'chmod 666 /jail/glftpd/dev/random' in all OSes

Lastly, add these lines to glftpd.conf:

 site_cmd DELGROUP       EXEC    /bin/delgroup.sh
 site_cmd READDGROUP     EXEC    /bin/delgroup.sh -readd
 
 custom-delgroup         1
 custom-readdgroup       1

Use 'site delgroup [-force] [-purge] <group>' and 'site readdgroup <group>'.
