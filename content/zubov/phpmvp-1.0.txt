PHP Movie Player

This will serve as a movie player jukebox for you.  It requires a 
webserver with php support.  It also requires mplayer to be able to play 
the movies.  The php layer (movie.php) allows you to browse your 
filesystem for the file(s) you want to play and the bash script 
(playmovie) handles the task of managing when to tell mplayer to play 
them.  There are a few config options at the top of both files that are 
self-explanatory.  I have a few ideas to add to this which I will do so 
if someone else actually runs a linux movie player like I do.
