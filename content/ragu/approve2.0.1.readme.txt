This script makes users (usually siteops and/or nukers) able to make an 
"Approved_by_$nick"-dir in a release, from irc. You can edit approve.tcl to
match some special flag the user must have to be able to use the script.

SETUP:
1. Edit approve.sh and approve.tcl to your liking.
2. Put approve.sh in /glftpd/bin/, load approve.tcl into your eggdrop, rehash,
   and you're all set
