Another nifty script for the public :)
This one shows the newest dirs in a specified section in an irchannel.
Edit both the .sh and .tcl and change "XXX" to whatever you like

Many thanks to WHiTECaT for the suggestion for this script :)

CHANGELOG:
1.0 Initial release
1.1 Fixed so you can use !xxxnew divx for a sectionname like dIVx, DIVX, Divx etc
1.2 Dunno...
1.3 Added a function to show newest pres as well
