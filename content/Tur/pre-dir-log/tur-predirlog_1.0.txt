PreDirLog (GL1&2)

Description: A script that logs which users enters the affiliated groups predir. 
Lists the last # of users.
The file is put in the predir itself so you can add it to show_diz and have it 
displayed when affils enter the predir.

This is a NOSUPPORT script. Dont message me about it unless you found a real bug 
(no "it dosnt work").
