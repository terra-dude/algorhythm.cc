Recommend (GL1&2)

Description: Set up a recommendation system for releases on your site. Made for 
sites with large archives where stuff is seldom removed.
Every user can add their "rank" of a release and it creates a symlink there.
Can also produce iMDB like ranking lists with the best/worst recommended releases. 
Keeps symlinks updated incase the release moves around.
