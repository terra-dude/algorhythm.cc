Archiver (GL1&2)

Description: This script will match something in a directory and move, copy or make
a symlink of that dir to another predefined dir. Good for most about everything 
like archiving KeyGens, archiving TV shows to their own dirs etc. Can be configured
to check that the release is completed and that its old enough (both definable) to 
be moved.
