Tur-MySQLSearch

Description: This is a package of two scripts. One that indexes your releases into 
a MySQL database (option to store size and keep it updated etc) and another script 
(.sh/.tcl) to search this database.

This works basically the same as 'site search' where the MySQL database is the 
dirlog. The difference is that the database also stores the sitename for each 
indexed release, so that if you have multiple sites, you can move to this system 
instead and have each box write to the same MySQL database. This way you can keep 
ONE search script that will search all the sites at once and displayes the site 
its on.

If you only have one site and have no other use for this database, you might as 
well stick to the standard 'site search' command.
