Section Gods (GL1&2)

Description: From irc, you can type (for instance) !gods DIVX and it will check 
owner of all files in that section and show the top 5 users in the channel. Pretty 
fun and equally useless :)
Check the.sh file for installation instructions.
Thanks to JanG for the idea and the file owner check string.
