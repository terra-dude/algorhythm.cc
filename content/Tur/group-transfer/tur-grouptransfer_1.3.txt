GroupTransfer (GL1&2)

Description: A script designed so that users can transfer credits within their own 
group. Tax can be defined as a "cost" so to speak and it has a few other goodies as
well.
Can be defined to specific groups only as well as all groups (if you want all your 
users to be able to transfer creds amongst eachother).
