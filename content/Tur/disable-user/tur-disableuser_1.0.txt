DisableUser (GL1&2)

Description: This is a rewrite of my ooold enable/disable script. It allows you to 
deny a user access to logon to your site from irc, shell or inside glftpd, without 
the risk of him being purged (which he can be if he's delled). You can then allow 
the user login when you wish as well as print a list of all disabled users.
From a users perspective, it will seem as the ftp is shut down.
