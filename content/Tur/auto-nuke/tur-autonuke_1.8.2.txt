AutoNuke (GL1&2)

Description: An autonuker script for multiple sections.
Will nuke not only empty dirs, but also look for incomplete symlinks and nuke 
anything not completed within the set time.
It can also pick up banned words in a release, as well as look for folders that 
does NOT contain any of the files you specify should be there.
You can also define sections where every release MUST include one of the words 
(Reversed Banned Words).
It will also remove symlinks that have no destination (cleanup from old nukes), as 
well as delete old nuked folders.
Run this with test mode to make sure it does what you want it to do.
It also has the option to send a pre-nuke warning from all 4 modules of the script,
to your glftpd.log file so the sitebot can pick it up and announce it.
Approved for RedHat, Mandrake, Debian, Slackware and FBSD (with included fbsd_ls.sh
script).
Check out the README in the package for full set of options.
