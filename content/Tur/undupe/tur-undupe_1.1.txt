Tur-UnDupe

Description: A public undupe script. Users can !undupe single files from irc. Works
in basically the same way as Eur0danc3s "Pubic Undupe" but this has a few more 
tricks like checking if it actually worked and more.
It is also 100% standalone from your sitebot script.

A note: Some versions of glftpd were releaed with a badly compiled undupe binary. 
If you cant run it from shell and get the usage information, you'll need to 
recompile it from undupe.c that comes with glftpd.
Simply: gcc -o /glftpd/bin/undupe undupe.c
