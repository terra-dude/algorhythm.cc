SectionSpace

Description: How to describe this? Hmm.
If you have multiple sections on the same harddrive and want to see how much space 
each section occupies, this is the script for you. You can also specify max amount 
of space allowed for each section, although that is only for display. It does NOT 
limit the amount in any way. Use some kind of quota for that.
Ment for shell/irc usage and comes with a tcl for your eggdrop to load.
