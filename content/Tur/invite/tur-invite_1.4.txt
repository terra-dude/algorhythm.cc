Invite (GL1&2)

Description: A standaline !invite script for +i chans.
Its ripped out from Dark0n3s dZSbot.tcl and enhanced to not invite users with flag 
6.
Always hated how dZSbot.tcl did that.

It can also announce differently depending on if the user is deleter or if he 
dosnt exist at all. 

You can specify special chans to invite to depending on what group(s) the user is 
in. Also, invite to specific chans only if the user specifies it (!invite user pass
mp3chan) 

If you want to upgrade your current dZSbot.tcl with this functionality, download it
and it tells you what to do. Otherwise it works fine stand alone too.
