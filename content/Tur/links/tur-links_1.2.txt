Links (GL1&2)

Description: Intended as an addon to Tur-Space but works fine as a standalone 
script as well.
You specify several dirs and one destination dir. The destination dir will then 
hold symlinks to every release from the source dirs. Its for those of you with the 
same section spread over multiple disks but still want to present all the releases 
on those disks in a central location.
You can specify as many of these as you like.
