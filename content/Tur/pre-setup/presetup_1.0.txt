PreSetup (GL1&2)

Description: No, this is not a Pre script. This is a Pre Setup script. Do you HATE 
making those folders and always forget something? Define your sections and how you 
want your symlinks (if at all) and it will create the folder, make the symlink 
folder (if on), create the actual symlink, chmod and chown the folders to your 
choice & give you the privpaths etc that you need to hide it in glftpd.conf. It 
will not edit any config files, just create the folders and tell you what you need 
to do so you can cut and paste. Edit the file for more details.
