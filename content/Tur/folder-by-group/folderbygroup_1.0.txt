FolderByGroup (GL1&2)

Description: Ment for MP3 dated dirs, but should work for 0days folder too. It 
will, when run at midnight, go through yesterdays (dated) folder and sort all 
releases by groupname. So
/0707/Rock_-_We-Love-Turranius-GayFeds
would be moved into
/0707/GayFeds/Rock_-_We-Love-Turranius-GayFeds.
It can also create a new dated dir and change the symlinks to it.
Edit the .sh for full documentions.
