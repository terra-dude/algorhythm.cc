Request (GL1&2)

Description: My own little request system. Works from both site and irc ( !request,
!reqfilled and !requests from irc ).
Will create a file to store requests and you can set glftpd to display that file 
when users enter the request dir.
It can also create the requested folder with a header you choose (REQ- by default),
and if that is on, rename the dir when reqfilled (FILLED- by default).
Announcing to chan is of course in as well. Instructions for zipscript-c included. 
Got a few more goodies too.
