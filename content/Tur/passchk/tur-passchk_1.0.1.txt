PassChk (GL1&2)

Description: Tur-Passchk is a replacement passchk for dark0n3s Zipscript-C. When 
using /msg botnick !invite, users can send a code instead of their real password 
for security. Issuing a command in glftpd will provide the users with his code 
which does not change unless he changes password on site. 
This is the easiest way to do this since it requires only one little change in 
dZSbot.tcl to enable (switch passchk binary option).
