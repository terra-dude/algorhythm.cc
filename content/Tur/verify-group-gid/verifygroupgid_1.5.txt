VerifyGroupGID (GL1&2)

Description: This is a small script that verifies (and fixes) that the users 
primary group is the gid defined for that user in the passwd.
Certain scripts forget to check this when adding or removing groups from userfiles 
*cough* tur-trial It will also check that each user has an entry in the passwd and 
that every line in the passwd matches a userfile.
