Tur-BandwidthLimit (GL1&2)

Description: This is a script that will measure the traffic your site has generated
over a defined period.
Once that limit is reached, it will do whatever you tell it to do.
Great for those paying for a certain traffic amount per month and want to close the
site down once it reaches a certain amount.
Can be configured to do almost anything and also to reverse what you tell it to do,
perhaps every new month or so.. Up to you.
