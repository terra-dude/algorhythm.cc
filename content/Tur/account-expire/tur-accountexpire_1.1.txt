Account Expire (GL1&2)

Description: Used to set a date for when to add or remove a certain flag. Designed 
to be used for temporary accounts who should be locked out at a certain date / 
number of days, but if you use your imagination, it can do so much more.
Glftpd 2 has account expire built in, but since you can use it for any flag at any 
time, I'll leave it anyway.
