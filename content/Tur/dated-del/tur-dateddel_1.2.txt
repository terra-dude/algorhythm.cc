DatedDel (GL1&2)

Description: A script to go through dated dirs and look for releases over a certain
size. It can then automatically delete those based on searchwords or ask you what 
to do as well as just log it.
Made for the simple reason that I do not want to archive games over 50 meg in the 
0DAY section. 
Comes with a few more options / settings.
