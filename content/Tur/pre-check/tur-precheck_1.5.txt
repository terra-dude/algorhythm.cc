PreCheck (GL1&2)

Description: A pre check script for when users uploads files. Ment as a standalone 
script OR a replacement for zipscript-c's precheck.sh
It can:
Only allow certain files to be uploaded. No more .imdb files, etc.
Ban certain files. No more site nfos, etc.
Block a user from uploading a .sfv file in a dir where there already is one. With

It can also check that all .rar/.mp3 files exists in sfv as well as preventing .zip
filse from different releases to be uploaded to the same directory.
