PreDirCheck (GL1&2)

Description: This script should be executed as a pre_dir_check script in 
glftpd.conf. It will prevent users from creating a dir where one already exists 
with a different case structure (Cd1/CD1).
If enabled, it will also check that the release was not previously uploaded (in 
another dir) or it was nuked.
Highly recomended for sites with dated dirs so users cant create a dir thats 
already in another dated dir.
