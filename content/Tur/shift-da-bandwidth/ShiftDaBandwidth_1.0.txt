ShiftDaBandwidth (GL1)

Description: A script to change the speed_limit in glftpd.conf. Set it up, and run 
it like ShiftDaBandwidth.sh 500 100 and it will set the max download speed to 
500k/sec and max upload to 100k/sec. Can kick users if you really need the change 
to happen NOW. Crontab it at the hours you want the change, with the numbers you 
want to change to. Read the .sh for full docs.
