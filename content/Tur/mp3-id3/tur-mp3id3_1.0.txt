Tur-Mp3ID3

Description: This is a script for those with mp3 sections. It grabs the id3 tags 
from the .mp3 files and stores them in a MySQL database.
Also included is a script that enables your users to search this database, from 
both glftpd and irc, based on the id3 tags.
Searching can be done based on artist, title, album, year, genre, releasename 
and/or filename.

Its actually kinda great to be able to search the entire site for some artist or 
similar.
