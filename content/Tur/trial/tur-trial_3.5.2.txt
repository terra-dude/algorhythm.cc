Tur-Trial 3 (GL1&2)

Description: The latest installation of Tur-Trial. Requires a mysql server but no 
real knowledge of mysql (comes with scripts to setup the database etc. All you need
to know is the mysql 'root' users password.). 

Supports both trial and quota. Multiple stat sections with different ratios. 
Month-Up top limit (keep only the top 10 users for example). 
Too many functions to list here really.
