Tur-Bandwidth List (GL1&2)

Description: A quick hack script used to display the bandwidth used in irc. It does
this by logging on to the ftp server and executing 'site traffic'.
You can choose which values to display (total/all/day etc). 

Since its a quick hack, the presented data looks exactly like 'site traffic' does. 
No preferences in the script to change that.
