Tur-Search (GL1&2)

Description: Gives !search function to irc and optionally replaces 'site search' in
glftpd.
Shows if the release still exists and if it does, show its size.
Also, from glftpd, it has the ability to create symlinks to the stuff it finds 
which is GREAT when searching for a few things. Can just tag all the symlinks 
instead of manually going to each dir to download.

Checks dirlog so use Tur-DirLogClean as well to keep dirlog updated.
