Public Rescan (GL1&2)

Description: Like eur0dance's Public Undupe, but for rescanning folders. Uses 
Dark0n3s rescan, so thats a requirement before using this (zipscript-c). !rescan 
works for everyone in your sitechan. Only 1 person can run it at a time. Works from
/msg to the bot too incase some affils needs to do it in private. See 
public_rescan.sh for documentation.
