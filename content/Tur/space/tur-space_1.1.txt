Tur-Space

Description: Tur-Space is a spacemaker script. It can move releases from your 
incoming sections to the archive or simply delete them. More then one archive can 
be defined per incoming section and it will move the release to the archive with 
the most space.
If no archive has enough space for it, it will delete the oldest releases in the 
archive until there is room. 
Requires 'tuls', also available from this website.
