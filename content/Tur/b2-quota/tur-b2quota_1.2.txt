Tur-B2Quota

Description: A script for those using B2's (BredBandsBolagets) 100 Mbit service 
with the nasty quota limit / month. Its simply a small perl script made by Cruxis 
that will report the available quota left and output this in shell.
Included are two scripts by turranius.
1: A tcl for your bot so you can get the current quota announced.
2: A .sh script that works as an alarm and will alert you if the limit gets below a
definable limit.
