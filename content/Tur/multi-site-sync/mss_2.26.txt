MultiSiteSync (MSS) (GL1&2)

Description: This is not for the faint of heart. Its a number of scripts, ment for 
people who want to run a multisite enviroment with the same userbase. 
It allows you to have one hub server and unlimited slave servers. You make any and 
all changes on the hub server and it is replicated onto the slave(s). Requires some
knowledge of what the heck you're doing. Credits and stats are seperated. Credits 
can be moved manually between sites by users and stats can be moved back to the hub
server for easy trials etc etc. Check the readme in the package for more info.

This baby has been tested on RedHat, Mandrake, Debian, Slackware, Fedora, FBSD 5.1,
5.2 and Gentoo.
