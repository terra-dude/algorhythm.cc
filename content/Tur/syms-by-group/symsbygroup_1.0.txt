SymsByGroup (GL1&2)

Description: Create folders based on groupname with a symlink to every release on 
site, from that group. Neat if you wish to have a SVCD.By.Group or similar folder. 
Works for dated dirs too (0days/Mp3). Supports more then one section. Simply define
where to look for releases and where you want those GroupName folders created.
