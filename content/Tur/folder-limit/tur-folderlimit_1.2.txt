FolderLimit (GL1&2)

Description: This script will make sure there are only a predefined number of 
folders in a section of your choise. Once there are more folders then you defined,
it will move the oldest ones to a second folder. If you want a nice clean incoming
section, or just want to limit the amount of, say, dated folders in a section, use
me!
