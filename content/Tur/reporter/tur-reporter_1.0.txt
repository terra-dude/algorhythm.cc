Description: This is a script ment to check logfiles. You specify the logfiles and 
what to look for in them, individually. It will then announce those things to your 
staff chan on IRC: Very handy for checking HD errors in /var/log/messages, but any 
logfile can be checked, as long as they are in clear text.
