IrcAdmin (GL1&2)

Description: A script for really lazy siteops who wants to use !site from irc. With
!site, you can do anything as you can normally from inside glftpd (ie, addip, 
adduser, purge, whatevah).
Locked by the tcl to only work in one chan.

If you cant get this one to work, v1.2 is the same thing but uses 'ncftp' instead 
of ftp. You'll find tur-ircadmin_1.2.tar.gz in "Downloads Quick/Turranius" to the 
left.
