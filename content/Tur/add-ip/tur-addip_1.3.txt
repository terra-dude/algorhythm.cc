AddIP (GL1&2)

Description: Script that lets users add/del/list their own IPs from irc. Also, 
changing ones tagline is possible.
Whats different from the other million similar scripts are that it uses ftp to 
actually log on as a siteop and add/del/list/change tagline. No changes directly to
the userfile which also means it automatically obeys any IP rules set in 
glftpd.conf. 
Users can also change tagline with this script. The tagline function is good if you
have a MSS ring where normal users does not have access to the HUB. With this, they
can still add IPs and change their tagline, which is about all users do anyway. 
Has some security settings, like dont allow certain flags to run it (bad if someone
gets hold of the siteops username and adds his own IP to it, etc). You can also set
a maximim number of IPs that are allowed in the userfile before the user is denied
access to add more without deleting some.
