Tur-OneLine_Stats

Description: This is an "addon" to glftpds stats binary. It outputs the 
position/user/megs on ONE line instead of multiple. Lots of variations on how you 
want the output. Works for both user and group stats.
Good if you want periodic output of stats in your channel or just want to replace 
your current !wkup commands (etc) with something that outputs the result on one 
line.
