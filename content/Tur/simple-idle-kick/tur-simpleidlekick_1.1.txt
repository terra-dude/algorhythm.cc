SimpleIdleKick (GL1&2)

Description: This is a simple idlekicker for those who think ktmf is too 
complicated. It works in a different way then ktmf in that it goes by the real 
idletime reported.
This will fix those mofos who manage to idle forever without executing any antiidle
commands.
Requires tur-ftpwho 3.0 atleast.
