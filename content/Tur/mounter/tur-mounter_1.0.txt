Tur-Mounter

Description: This is a script for those that use removable disks and know the 
problem with them always getting a, more or less, random device ID each time you 
boot up the box or umount them.

Basically, you create a file on each disk and when this script is executed, it 
mounts the disks where they want to be mounted, according to the disk itself.
Can also be used on "normal" disks if you, for some reason, does not like to use 
fstab.
