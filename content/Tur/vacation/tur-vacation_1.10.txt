Vacation (GL1&2)

Description: If you are tired of handling people on vacation all the time, let this
script do it! Users issue a command on site which adds them to a group and 
(optionally) disables their ability to upload and/or download A minumum time is 
optional so they can not just change over night to pass any monthly quotas, etc. 
Naturally, it also has support for Dark0n3's zipscript incase you want bot output 
in irc. Siteops can also get a full list of everyone on vacation and for how long. 
Can also work together with Tur-Trial 2.1+ to deduct quota limit if the user was on
vacation this month.
