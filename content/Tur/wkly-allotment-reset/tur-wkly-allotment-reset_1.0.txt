Wkly-Allotment-Reset (GL1&2)

Description: A script to make sure the users does not have more credits then what 
is specified at the start of each week. 

Sometime in glftpd life, the reset binary changed so that if you have MORE credits 
than your wkly allotment if would allow you to keep it. Previously it would have 
reset it to the allotment value anyway. I have been told this will be fixed in 
glftpd 2.0 or atleast so you can specify the reset binaries behaviour. This script 
should therefor only be needed for glftpd 1.3+ 

Now, for MSS in particular, this new way of reseting credits is NO GOOD, since the 
user can just transfer credits to the slaves above his allotment value and simply 
build the credits up more and more each week. 

Hence this script. It will check if its the correct day to reset and if any user 
has more credits then his allotment value specifies, it will reset him down to that
value. 

It is a COMPLEMENT to the reset binary and not a replacement in any kind. reset 
still handles the stats and in some occations, the wkly_allotment. 

In case you use MSS, it should be loaded on both the hub and all the slaves.
