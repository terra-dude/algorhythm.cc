1. Install:

	  1. unpack to a directory called "sitebot" in your eggdrop scripts dir.
	  2. run installer.sh
	  3. START THE BOT!
	  4. dcc chat the bot --> .chattr yourself +C.
	  5. type ".addons list" for addons u want to install.
	  6. type ".addons get <addon_name>" for everything u need.
	  7. setup the variables how you want through edit the
	     files sitebot-glftpd.cfg and sitebot-glftpd.api or with .sset

	  NOTE: Remeber dont edit the sitebot-default.skin file. Instead copy lines from it
		and add them to ur sitebot-skin-whatever name you like.skin file. Its because 
		everytime you update the bot the default file will be over write.
	      
	  NOTE: If u want the announce and jtc to work as it should with the sitebot.
              	Dont forget to install them with the installer.
              	And don't forget to add the following line to your crontab.
              	
              	55 23 * * *             /glftpd/bin/jtc -d
              
          NOTE: If you use the Request addon, don't forget to edit siterequest.conf and add the following
          	lines to your glftpd.conf
          	
          	site_cmd request       EXEC    /bin/siterequest.sh request
		site_cmd reqfilled     EXEC    /bin/siterequest.sh reqfilled
		site_cmd requests      EXEC    /bin/siterequest.sh status
		site_cmd reqdel        EXEC    /bin/siterequest.sh reqdel
		site_cmd reqwipe       EXEC    /bin/siterequest.sh reqwipe

		custom-request         1
		custom-reqfilled       *
		custom-requests        *
		custom-reqdel          1
		custom-reqwipe         1     

		If you forget this, you will have 2 different request systems in use, this means different Request
		output in you bot announces than in your glftpd commands.	
	  	
2. Description:

          sitebot-glftpd.tcl basically brings together the whole package of
          scripts for glftpd.. there are five different subsections
          which i will go over in a diminative time as possible :). please
          note that i've made this script as configurable as possible so you
          don't need to touch the tcl for anything anymore; you can turn
          just about every feature on and off etc.  editing can be done through
          sitebot-glftpd.cfg and sitebot-glftpd.api manually.

	  At times especially of late you may find it necessary to have your sitebot
	  on more then one network ive provided two solutions to this:
	  
          1. sitebot-leaf.tcl - run this on another bot which you have linked to your current
             sitebot you can use it to announce all announces to one other channel useful 
             if you want to echo to more then one net.

	  2. in your eggdrop config file if you want to run two bots out of the same directory
	     add these lines to your eggdrop config.
		set sitebot(api) "sitebot-glftpd.api2"
		set sitebot(cfg) "sitebot-glftpd.cfg2"
	     run your bot once you will find these files will be generated... edit the 
	     appropriate values and so on... you can use any names really.
	  

	  announce section
            - full support for any entries to glftpd.log and announcing these lines
              in a formatted way to a specific set of channels based on what type
	      and stat section they belong too.	
	    - easy to change "look" of announces and what lines to look for in 
	      glftpd.log through the use of sitebot-glftpd.api file which can
	      be edited manually.

          statistics section
            - a variety of information which you can have your bot spit out
              to a channel when triggered, such as weektops, bandwidth usage, etc.

		!ver		    	- Show Version.
		!build <opt addon|all> 	- Show Builds.

          dcc chat section
            - a package for easy management of your sitebot.
              some commands include (.supdate).
            - the flags in eggdrop for different userlevels are as follows.. the
	      different userlevels will give you access to different combinations
	      of the below commands.

                +C = siteop

		.leafbots	check leafs connected to the hub.. only on sitebot-glftpd.tcl
		.hubbots	check hubs connected to a leaf.. only on sitebot-leaf.tcl
		.timers		check the timers runing
		.savecfg	save cfg changes
		.saveapi	save api changes
		.announce <msg>
		.set		change sitebot settings
	    
          invite section
            - able to:
                /msg botname !invite <glusername> <glpassword>

	  updater section
                .update version     - checks to see if you have the latest version
	        .update tarball          - downloads latest sitebot tar.gz to your scripts/sitebot dir
      	        .update install          - downloads and installs latest sitebot-glftpd tcl
 	        .update install nocheck  - downloads and installs latest sitebot-glftpd tcl (doesnt makesure your running an old version)
	    
          addon section
         	.addons version     - checks to see if you have the latest addon versions
         	.addons list        - lists available addons
         	.addons info        - give some info about the addon and changelog
         	.addons get <name>  - download and install an addon
         	.addons del <name>  - delete an addon from your scripts/sitebot dir 

	  Most of the features on this bot can be changed, turned on or off etc through 
	  your cfg and api files. if you are upgrading your bot then place your old 
	  .cfg file with the new tcl and it will take whatever old settings you have 
	  and put them into a new config file.

          ... anyway ON with the show! :)

3. Requirements:

        * The script has been tested on eggdrop 1.1.x , 1.3.x and 1.4.x. 1.6.x the
          script runs on all versions of glftpd but obviously if a feature
          is not in your version of glftpd or you haven't set it up, such as
          seperate stat section in the glftpd.conf file, this tcl will not
          magically do it for you.

	  * you need these files in your glftpd bin  (normally "/glftpd/bin") 

	    df, tail
	
	  * you need these files in your eggdrop scripts directory

		sitebot-glftpd.tcl	- duh?:)
		sitebot-glftpd.cfg	- (if one doesnt exist default config will be generated.)
		sitebot-glftpd.api	- (if one doesnt exist default api will be generated.)
		sitebot-default.skin	- (if one doesnt exist default will be downloaded.)

  	  * You need atleast tcl8.3 running on your system and http 2.3

        * The bot needs a login on the ftp site, which if you want bnc feature
          to run properly.

        * For those worried about their hosts showing on the bot, I've
          packed the bnc tcl by kenwood which you can use to get your bot
          to use a bnc.  If you don't know what i mean when i say bnc (bounce), go
          download it and read the info files that come with it. ;p

        * Only set a user to +S or +C not a combination of the three

             +C = Siteop Flag
             +S = Staff Flag

4. Extra Notes  
	  
	  Feel free to use this code but please don't forget to give credit
          to me and to dalix for the original concept.  Moreover, if you use
          particular features of this script which I've credited to other
          people, you must give them credit as well.  If this tcl,
          in any way, shape, or form, is responsible for screwing up your
          site, computer, or sex life...i take no responsibility.  use at
          your own risk! :)

          I'm interested in developing this script further still so if you
          have any ideas that you think would be good for this script or
          any bugs to report please go to my forums on:

	    http://

	  Alternativly, you can send me a message via dcc chat in your bot like: 
          ".smsgauthor yourEmail <message>" although you are limited to a 
	    relativly short message.

	  When you enable/disable some features on the fly it wont actually
	  be disabled/enabled until you rehash/restart the bot.. so to be 
	  on the safe side if you change alot of things .die your bot and
	  load it up again.

	  Please remember the announce section of this TCL primarily is to
	  report what information is put into the glftpd.log file.. your zipscript
	  is what is responsible for putting extra info such as racers, complete
	  info, sfv update etc etc.. so you must use a zipscript which will 
	  put this info to the log file if you want to have this information
	  been reported by your sitebot.

	  If the config/api files are old or missing the bot will generate new
	  ones for you.

5. Tips   Where you have your sitebot's username set do !login so that it
          will kill its ghost if one is there when you test the bnc.
