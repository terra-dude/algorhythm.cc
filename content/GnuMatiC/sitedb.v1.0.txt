#
# DESCRIPTION:
# This is a site database script to be ran with an eggdrop. It allows users of a channel 
# to add and remove sites from the database. It also allows users to update various 
# information to help keep track of sites. Almost every option allows the scripter to
# fully customize which features they want to use.
# This script ALSO can be used in multiple channels, allowing only one database to be used
# but keeping that information private from the other channels, so each channel that the eggdrop
# is running in with this script, can each have their own private lists of sites.
