### Installation ###
Edit sitebnc.tcl and change it to fit your needs.
Do the same with sitebnc.sh.
Copy the sitebnc.tcl to your eggdrop's script directory.
Add "source scripts/sitebnce.tcl" to your eggdrop config file.
Copy sitebnc.sh to your glftpd bin directory and chmod a+x.
Add a crontab. My line locks like this. It will run every 10 minutes.
0,10.20.30.40.50 * * * * /glftpd/bin/sitebnc.sh
Then it's done. If your bot was running rehash it.
