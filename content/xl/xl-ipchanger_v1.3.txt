xL-ipchanger v1.3 README
------------------------
I was tired of adding and deleting ip's all the time so i wrote a script for it. 

CHANGELOG
---------
1.0
Added !delip

1.1
Added !listip

1.2
Now the script won't do anything unless the IP to add/del contains a "@"
It will still report the addip/delip to the user though
This is just to avoid abusing from idiots who want to rearrange their userfile :P

1.3
Changed lots of things in both .tcl and .sh
Added some new features
* Force users to add an ident.
* Limit the number of IP's that the users are allowed to add.
* IP won't be added unless it contains the correct amount of numbers.
  For example you can't add 192.168.* or *@192.168.
* You can decide how many IP numbers the users have to specify
* It will tell you if the ip you want to delete doesn't exist or if 
  the ip you want to add already exists.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This script will allow the users to addip and delip on their own by using
  /msg <botnick> !addip/!delip <username> <password> <ident@ip>
The users are also able to view their current IP's by using 
  /msg <botnick> !listip <username> <password>
Everything will be logged and you are able to read the last 10 (change this if you want :P) 
changes of that log by using 
  /msg sitebot !ipchanges (for ops only)
Of course you can read it manually too.
The bot's shell account has to have write permission on every user file.

INSTALLATION
------------
* Extract the file ( gzip -dc xl-ipchanger_v1.3.tar.gz | tar -xof- ) 
* Edit and copy xl-ipchanger.sh to /glftpd/bin and chmod a+x
* Copy xl-ipchanger.tcl to your eggdrop script dir and add it to your eggdrop.conf
* touch /glftpd/ftp-data/logs/xl-ipchanger.log and chmod 777
* Make the bot owner of the user files by putting something like this in your crontab ( crontab -e ):
0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * chown <bot's shell user> /glftpd/ftp-data/users/* > /dev/null 2>&1
