GLFTPD SCRIPTS

Please take note that these scripts come without instructions on how to set them up, it is sole responsibility of the end user to understand the scripts function before executing them. If you do not know how to execute them, then please don't use them. They come with no warranty should any damage happen due to the improper settings and execution of these scripts (missing data, etc).

These GLFTPD 'SiGSCRiPT' aka 'sig-script' scripts are provided in order to automate laborious tasks within a GLFTPD environment. They are all custom scripted by me 'signor' aka 'sigscript' for others to use free of charge.

Each script provided has a small header to show the basic function of the script, and how to set it up. There are no mention of what libraries or binaries needed to make the script funtion, that is up to you to sort out.
