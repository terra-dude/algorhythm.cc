Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a script by eur0dance to create links to MP3 releases according
to genres, artist names and groups that made those release. This script
is based on Jehsom's mp3 linker script called mp3links.cron. The new
feature which was added is that it doesn't remove the contents of the
link dirs anymore, it removes all the dead links and adds only the new links.
This way the new release will have a correct date which is useful when you
want to sort by date and see only the new releaseD. A great advantage of this
script is that it doesn't rely on anything that you might do with your
releases, such as moving them from place to place, preing and so on.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
You need to run it from a crontab once a day (you can run it twice or more if you
want, but generally once should be enough). I suggest to run it at 1:00 am during
the midnight.

Put the mp3links.sh file your glftpd's bin dir, edit the configuration section
in it as it explained there through the comments.

Add the following line to your crontab (edit your glftpd's bin path if needed) :
0 1 * * *      /glftpd/bin/mp3links.sh >/dev/null 2>&1

Enjoy!
