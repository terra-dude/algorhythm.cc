                                    =================================
Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a public undupe script. By public I mean that anybody on the site channel can undupe
any file. This is good if you want to enable your users to undupe files if no siteop or users with
C flag are around. Due to the fact that the command is done on the channel - everybody can see it
and report if there is an abuse. This script is meant for people who are experienced with Linux/Unix. 
If you don't understand something about how to set it or why doesn't it work, try to understand the
comments inside the "undupe.sh" file. I can't really help you beyond that. The script has been tested
on RedHat and Debian. I am sure it works on Slackwere/Mandrake as well. About *BSD systems, it might not
work there, if it does, let me know, if not and you fixed it, plz notify me about the fix so I could add
it to the next version of this script.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.
  Copy the "undupe.sh" file to your glftpd bin dir and read VERY carefully to my comments inside,
  especially the "Installation" section, everything is there.
2.
  The script isn't standalone one, it works together with the sitebot tcl. This means you need to
  bind a function for it to pub "!<sitename>undupe" command for channel. For zipscript-c and project-zs
  scripts by DarK0n3 this is done by adding the following line to dZSbot.tcl:

  bind pub -|- [set cmdpre]undupe undupe

  After adding it you need to add the actual undupe function which will invoke the
  "undupe.sh" script and print its output to the channel. Again for Dark0n3 zipscripts
  this is the function you need to add to dZSbot.tcl (if your glftpd bin path is not standard
  you will need to edit it in this function):
 
  #################################################################################
  # UNDUPE A FILE                                                                 #
  #################################################################################
  proc undupe {nick uhost hand chan args} {
   global cmdpre sitename
    if {[lindex $args 0] != "" } {
       set output [exec /glftpd/bin/undupe.sh [lindex $args 0]]
    } else {
       set output [exec /glftpd/bin/undupe.sh]
    }   
    putserv "PRIVMSG $chan :-$sitename- \[PUBLIC UNDUPE\] - $output"
  }
  #################################################################################

  If you use a different sitebot tcl than the one supplied with zipscript-c/project-zs
  then you need to do something very similar to what I wrote, of course with the needed
  changes, according to your sitebot tcl script.

Enjoy!

P.S
   I can only help you with this script if you find errors inside my documentation 
   (which shouldn't happen) or find some bug (which shouldn't happen as well, since I've
   tested the script on two sites for some time).
