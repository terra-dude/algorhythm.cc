                                          logtrimmer_pack_v1.0 by eur0dance
                                          =================================
Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is my public release of the logtrimmer script. I just documented what I use myself on sites with a small
root partition which can get filled quickly by glftpd logs and released it as v1.0. The pack consists of two 
"modules": 
 1. logtrimmer.sh  --> takes care of glftpd & zipscript logs, apart from "dirlog and "dupelog"
 2. dirlogtrimmer --> A binary which takes care of the dirlog by rotating it, in order words it
                      keeps it limited by a defined file size by removing the oldest entries.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The whole documentation for "logtrimmer.sh" inside the file itself. Just copy it to your glftpd bin dir
and read carefully the comments in it.
In order to install "dirlogtrimmer" do:
 1. "make"
 2. If your glftpd bin dir is a standard one, do "make install", if not just copy the "dirlogtrimmer"
    binary to your glftpd bin dir.
 3. In order to use it, crontab it like this: 30 7 * * * /usr/sbin/chroot /glftpd /bin/dirlogtrimmer 5000
    Where "30 7" means it will run at 7:30 each day and "5000" is the number of records (entries) to leave
   (if there are more records than this, the oldest will be deleted in order to make it 5000 again).

Enjoy!
