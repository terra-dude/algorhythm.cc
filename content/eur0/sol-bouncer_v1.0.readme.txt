sol-bouncer v1.0 - FTP bouncer for Solaris Sparc and Solaris Intel by eur0dance <eur0dance@lithium.moods.be>
Based on foo.Bouncer v1.22 source code by Tanesha, all credits go to Tanesha Team <tanesha@tanesha.net>


Features of the original bouncer:
	* Very stable, tested/fixed for over a year on high-usage-
	  ftps.
	* Allows easy distributing of traffic to multiple IPs
	  without use of slow databouncing.
	* Only works with glftpd, uncomment the ident stuff
	  if you want a generic bouncer.
	* Comes with source, you can change as you like :)

Features of the sol-bouncer:
	* Slght code changes
	* Makefile
	* Compiles fine on Solaris (SunOS)

A few hints on usage are:

Compiling:
	make

Setting up configuration:
	vi sol-bouncer.conf

Running for the first time (to test things):
	./sol-bouncer sol-bouncer.conf

Setting up crontab-check script:
	vi sol-bouncer.sh

Running crontabbed (permanently):
	crontab -e
	Add something like this line (change the path to crontab-check script): 
		0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * *   /export/home/eur0dance/sol-bouncer/sol-bouncer.sh >/dev/null 2>&1

Enjoy!
